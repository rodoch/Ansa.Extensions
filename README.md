# Ansa.Extensions

This is a tiny collection of general-purpose extension methods I use to make life easier when developing ASP.NET applications. Some of the better ones I've grabbed from some great open-source projects (see Credits below). I'll continue adding to this as I find new shortcuts.

## Credit where credit is due

The `IsNullOrEmpty()` and `HasValue()` methods are taken from the rather exceptional [StackExchange.Exceptional](https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional) repo.
